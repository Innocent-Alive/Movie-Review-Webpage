                Dodge Tyner (Liam Hemsworth) is getting desperate. His fledgling construction

                him pass out. They tell him it's a brain tumor, and that he's terminal. 
                So when he comes into contact with Miles Sellars, an executive type who runs 
                something called The Tiro Fund, Dodge is inclined to listen to Sellars unlikely sales pitch. 
                He's incredulous, but doesn't immediately walk away. “You want them to hunt me?”<br />

                <strong>Interstellar</strong> is a 2014 movie that was directed by <em>Christopher Nolan</em> and written by <em>Christopher Nolan</em> and <em>Jonathan Nolan</em>. The film received four Academy Award nominations for Best Original Score, Best Production Design, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Sound Editing - and the VFX (Visual Effects) were so well regarded that they won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects.<br />
                Although Interstellar received good-not-great reviews upon release, it's since garnered more acclaim and it frequently places on lists of the best sci-fi movies ever made.<br />
                Interstellar is about Earth's last chance to find a habitable planet before a lack of resources causes the human race to go extinct. The film's protagonist is Cooper (<em>Matthew McConaughey</em>), a former NASA pilot who is tasked with leading a mission through a wormhole to find a habitable planet in another galaxy.<br />
                Dr. Brand (<em>Michael Caine</em>) explains to Cooper that NASA previously sent another group (Lazarus) to find a habitable planet but they've gone silent.<br />
